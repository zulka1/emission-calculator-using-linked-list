Human activities produce greenhouse gases that trigger climate change, so their impact needs to be measured using the Carbon Footprint concept (total emissions in g CO₂, CH4, and N2O). Given that each activity has a different emission calculation, structured data management is essential for accuracy. This understanding is crucial for building environmental awareness and changing consumption patterns to reduce the impact of harmful emissions.


The carbon emissions calculator helps us understand that everyday activities like electricity use, vehicles, and food consumption produce carbon emissions that impact the environment. With a simple calculation, users can determine how much carbon they emit each day, helping them become more aware of their habits.
